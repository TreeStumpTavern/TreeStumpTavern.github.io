        <h1>The Tree Stump Tavern</h1>
        <p>Welcome weary travelers to Baldur's Gate's newest and safest establishment, The Tree Stump Tavern. 
            I am Stumpie, Poet Laureate of the recently recovered Holy City of Elturel, and owner of 
            this establishment here. You may have heard of my adventures in Avernus, where I and my friends took on the forces of the 
            Nine Hells to return the city of Elturel to the Material Plane, or you may have read about it in my autobiography 
            "<em>Stumpie: How I faced my inner Demons, and found my inner Hero, by fighting real actual horrifying Devils, 
                in the uppermost layer of the Nine Hells - Avernus, a bard's tale</em>". Would you like me to sign you a copy?</p>
 
	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>Hey there, my name is Matt and I have been a "forever DM" now for over a decade. My girlfriend has been a part of every campaign, 
        and a while back she showed interest in me DMing for her university friend group. 
        I decided to run the one shot 
        <a href="https://www.dmsguild.com/product/294663/Baldurs-Gate-The-Fall-of-Elturel" target="_blank"><em>The Fall of Elturel</em></a> 
        (one of the best one shots I've ever read) and when the group showed interest in a full campaign, I decided to run the 
        <em>Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus</em> module.</p>

	<p>One of the party members was Gaia, who is an amazing artist. After our campaign concluded, I suggested to her to start a webcomic that summarizes our previous campaign, and then potentially start working on a custom story of our own. With me doing the writing, storyboarding, and website programming, and Gaia doing the art, character and style design, and shading/colouring, we could use this website to visualize any story that we participated in, be it something from a campaign, a one shot, a vision, or a video game.</p>

	<p>For the moment we plan to finish up a campaign summary (which we expect to be 6 pages long), after which we will begin working on our next story, which we hope to update somewhat consistently. In between all of that we might share small little bits of character art, works-in-progress, and anything else that comes to mind. This website serves first and foremost as an outlet for our creative interests, in whatever shape they may manifest.</p>

	<p>You can follow Gaia on Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ga.lsart/" target="_blank">@ga.lsart</a> and learn more about me on my <a href="https://www.enginenoir.com" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
