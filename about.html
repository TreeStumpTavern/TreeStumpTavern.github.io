        <h1>The Tree Stump Tavern</h1>
        <p>Welcome weary travelers to Baldur's Gate's newest and safest establishment, The Tree Stump Tavern.</p> 

        <div id="authorBlurb">
            <p>You may be wondering: Tree Stump? Safest? Who are you? To which I say, give me a moment and all will be made clear.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>The Tree Stump?</h2>
            <p>Yes, the name may not immediately invoke the kind of heroic bravado that 
                "The Dragon's Den", or the "Sword and Hearth" may carry, but it carries the conviction and belief that all brave heroes
                spring from the same roots. These roots are Righteousness, Altruism, Honour, and Valor!<br>
                Also I, Stumpie, am a green half-orc, and trees are plants. The tree <em>Stump</em>? Yeah, you get it. Next question!
            </p>
            <h2>Safest?</h2>
            <p>Aye! This establishment is about as safe as you'll get here in Baldur's Gate. We make sure no
            Zhentarim or Thayan pickpockets get to make their rounds here. Did your coinpurse become lighter anyway? Well, friend, you may have been
            chosen to contribute to the great and noble plight of the Harpers, agents of justice. Next time around, try to at least pretend you're not
            from the Upper City, and in the meantime, take pride in knowing that your contributions are being put to good use against the forces of evil!
            </p>
            <h2>Who are you?</h2>
            <p>Who am <em>I</em>? Why I am Stumpie, Poet Laureate of the recently recovered Holy City of Elturel, and owner of 
            this establishment here, the Tree Stump Tavern. You may have heard of my adventures in Avernus, where I and my friends took on the forces of the 
            Nine Hells to return the city of Elturel to the Material Plane, or you may have read about it in my autobiography "<em>Stumpie: How I faced my inner Demons, 
            and found my innder Hero, by fighting real Devils in Avernus, a bard's tale</em>".<br> Would you like me to sign you a copy?</p>
